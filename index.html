			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/deckard.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Bob Deckard">

			<p>High school was a struggle for me, mostly due to a curious, creative, and over active mind that was stuck in a redundant system where I would thrash against the walls of traditional education. My parents and teachers were of the opinion that I was a lazy daydreamer…. the truth was somewhere in the middle (well, not exactly in the middle, honestly much closer to the daydreamer side.) 
In my first year of college I really blossomed, unfortunately not in academics. With a very mediocre attempt at a semester in college I decided to try to find work with my Uncle Sam.
In the Army I leaned the self discipline I needed to focus my curious creativity toward academic study, and I started school as soon as I got out.  A Zoology degree later I found myself teaching 8th grade science in the very same system that I had flailed against so many years prior.</p>

			<p>
Teach, test, teach, test, and so on… teachers taught, kids learned (or didn’t) and the years rolled on. For 14 years and across 5 different grades and almost all subjects of science I pushed to change the way education worked. I changed, refined, threw out, started over, changed, went back to the trash can to brush the coffee grounds off the old stuff to realize it wasn’t that bad… etc. I knew that the traditional school was ok for the traditional student, but not for students like me.
I find myself now in the cyberworld and I know that we possess the tools to finally make education tailored exactly to what a student needs.</p>
